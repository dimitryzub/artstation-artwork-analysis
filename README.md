# Artstation Artwork Analysis

## Content
100.000 artwork links (just links) which are equivalent to ~30 days time period from the day that links were gathered.
There're 50.000 artworks that were scraped and contain data, ~40.000+ unique (*artwork from the same artist*).
 
Dataset includes such columns:
- Role
- Company work at (if mentioned or extracted)
- Date artwork was posted
- Number of views
- Number of likes
- Number of comments
- Which software was used
- Which tags were used
- Artwork title
- Artwork URL

As you see the disclaimer, it's the first time I'm doing this. I want anyone who will be using this dataset to keep artists privacy by **not** using **artist's email addresses** in any way even though it's publicly available data published by them. Correct me if I said something wrong here.

### Goals

The goal of this project was to better understand the process of gathering data, processing, cleaning, analyzing and vizualizing. 
Besides that, I wanted to understand what is the most popular software, tag, affiliation amoung artists.

### Inspiration

While transitioning from 3D modeling to Data Analytics and Python Programming I decided to create a personal project to analyze something I have a close connection. I really enjoyed seeing progression in the 3D world (games, feature films, etc).

### To scrape data these Python libraries/packages were used:
- `requests`
- `json`
- `googlesheets api`
- `selenium`
- `regex`

### To clean, analyze and visualize data:
- `googlesheets`
- `tableau`

> Disclaimer, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm learning data analysis for a little over a month. I just really like the process and the power of data.
